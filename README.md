# Revisiting-a-Concrete-Strength-regression-Kagglession
This model predicts the concrete strength based on 7 features Cement,Slag,Flyash,Water,Coarseaggregate,Fineaggregate,Age
The input features had a strong non-linear relationship with the target. Instead of using Random Forest I've used Polynomial Regression with degree 3. The performance is very close to ensemble method.
